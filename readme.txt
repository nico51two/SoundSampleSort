Hello ChatGPT,
I have a large collection of sound samples in wav format ranging from several milliseconds to several seconds in length. They are mostly one shot samples but some are longer loops. They are all housed in the same folder and not sorted or sensibly named. I would like to have them sorted by sound characteristics, i. e. I want hi hat samples to be in one folder and kick drum samples in another, etc. They can not be easily distinguished by length. I would like to write some code (preferably in python or R) that does a spectral and transient analysis and sorts them into folders accordingly. Can you help me with that?

ChatGPT:
Yes, I can help you with that. Here are the steps you can take to sort your sound samples by their characteristics using Python:

- Install the required packages: You will need to install the following packages: NumPy, SciPy, and Librosa. You can install them using pip or conda.

- Load the audio files: Use the librosa.load() function to load the audio files from the folder.

- Extract audio features: Use librosa.feature functions to extract audio features like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), spectral centroid, spectral contrast, spectral rolloff, and zero-crossing rate.

- Cluster the audio features: Use a clustering algorithm like k-means to cluster the audio features.

- Move the audio files to their respective folders: Based on the cluster labels, move the audio files to their respective folders.
