Hello ChatGPT,
I have a large collection of sound samples in wav format ranging from several milliseconds to several seconds in length. They are mostly one shot samples but some are longer loops. They are all housed in the same folder and not sorted or sensibly named. I would like to have them sorted by sound characteristics, i. e. I want hi hat samples to be in one folder and kick drum samples in another, etc. They can not be easily distinguished by length. I would like to write some code (preferably in python or R) that does a spectral and transient analysis and sorts them into folders accordingly. Can you help me with that?

ChatGPT:
Yes, I can help you with that. Here are the steps you can take to sort your sound samples by their characteristics using Python:

- Install the required packages: You will need to install the following packages: NumPy, SciPy, and Librosa. You can install them using pip or conda.

- Load the audio files: Use the librosa.load() function to load the audio files from the folder.

- Extract audio features: Use librosa.feature functions to extract audio features like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), spectral centroid, spectral contrast, spectral rolloff, and zero-crossing rate.

- Cluster the audio features: Use a clustering algorithm like k-means to cluster the audio features.

- Move the audio files to their respective folders: Based on the cluster labels, move the audio files to their respective folders.

Features to extract:

    Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs): MFCCs are a set of features that represent the spectral characteristics of an audio signal. They are computed by taking the discrete cosine transform (DCT) of the log-magnitude Mel-spectrogram. MFCCs capture the most important spectral characteristics of the audio signal and are widely used in speech and music recognition.

    Spectral centroid: The spectral centroid is a measure of the center of mass of the spectral distribution of an audio signal. It represents the frequency around which most of the energy of the signal is concentrated. A higher spectral centroid indicates a higher frequency content in the signal.

    Spectral contrast: Spectral contrast is a measure of the difference between the peak and valley magnitudes in the spectral distribution of an audio signal. It represents the overall spectral shape of the signal. A higher spectral contrast indicates a more complex spectral shape.

    Spectral rolloff: The spectral rolloff is a measure of the frequency below which a specified percentage (usually 85%) of the spectral energy of the signal is contained. It represents the amount of high-frequency content in the signal. A higher spectral rolloff indicates a higher amount of high-frequency content.

    Zero-crossing rate: The zero-crossing rate is a measure of the number of times the waveform of an audio signal crosses the zero axis per unit time. It represents the rate of change of the waveform. A higher zero-crossing rate indicates a more rapidly changing waveform.
