Hello ChatGPT,
I have a large collection of sound samples in wav format ranging from several milliseconds to several seconds in length. They are mostly one shot samples but some are longer loops. They are all housed in the same folder and not sorted or sensibly named. I would like to have them sorted by sound characteristics, i. e. I want hi hat samples to be in one folder and kick drum samples in another, etc. They can not easily distinguished by length. I would like to write some code (preferrably in python or R) that does a spectral and transient analysis and sorts them into folders accordingly. Can you help me with that?
